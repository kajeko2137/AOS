# A6OS

A bare-metal operating system for the **Raspberry Pi 1 Model B**, written entirely in ARM assembly. The project features physical page allocation, advanced ARMv6 Extended Page Table MMU initialization, process isolation across User/Supervisor modes, and a fully functional software interrupt (SWI) system call dispatcher for dynamic process memory management.

## Hardware Target

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Board** | Raspberry Pi 1 Model B |
| **SoC** | Broadcom BCM2835 |
| **CPU** | ARM1176JZF-S (ARMv6) |
| **RAM** | 512 MB |
| **Kernel load address** | `0x8000` |

## Features

- **BSS zeroing** — clears uninitialized data at boot using fast 16-byte `stmia` writes.
- **UART0 (PL011) driver** — serial output at 115200 baud over GPIO 14/15. Supports character, string, and 32-bit hex printing.
- **Physical page allocator** — tracks all 131,072 4KB pages across 512MB of RAM using a byte array tracking.
- **MMU & Virtual Memory** — creates L1 coarse tables and initializes ARMv6 Extended Page Table format (SCTLR.XP enabled) mapping the kernel identity region (0x0+) and 512MB RAM physical translation through higher-half offsets (0x80000000+).
- **Process Memory Isolation (L2 Tables)** — maps separate 4KB virtual pages per process into L2 coarse tables restricting User mode constraints. The code is mapped at `0x00100000`, heap at `0x00101000`, and stack memory dynamically mapped and shrinking downwards from `0x00200000` (L2[255]). Process mappings track internally and discard upon deletion.
- **System Calls (SWI dispatcher)** — features a system call handler tracking software interrupt triggers. Handlers preserve exception execution states and process registers returning control safely to user execution loop.
- **Dynamic User Memory Allocation & Deallocation** — provides processes the ability to ask for additional physical pages mapped seamlessly. The allocator features O(1) bump-allocation speed and scales limitlessly by dynamically creating hidden L2 translation tables across contiguous page gaps. Processes selectively return memory via SWI 3 (`sys_free_page`), and completely empty memory tracks autonomously prune their dead configuration descriptors.
- **Lazy Memory Mapping** — seamlessly intercepts physical access to unused virtual heap boundaries via the kernel's Data Abort Exception handler, instantly and transparently provisioning precisely allocated new memory physical sections invisibly to the executing application.

## Boot Sequence

```
ROM (SoC) → bootcode.bin → start.elf → kernel.img (A6OS)
         Stage 1        Stage 2      Stage 3       ARM CPU
```

On startup, the kernel:

1. Maps initial CPU execution contexts setting stack pointers for `ABT`, `UND`, `IRQ`, `FIQ`, `SYS`, and `SVC` modes.
2. Zeroes the `.bss` section.
3. Initializes UART0 for serial debug output.
4. Initializes master MMU translating kernel layout across hardware contexts.
5. Launches process creation (setting isolated code mapping, initial heap/stack pages).
6. Hands execution to user mode launching `process1`.
7. Intercepts SWI interrupts dispatched from `process1`.
8. Cleans process references automatically when terminated by kernel syscalls and halts gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- **ARM cross-toolchain** — `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, `arm-none-eabi-ld`, `arm-none-eabi-objcopy`
- **wget** — for fetching the GPU bootloader files
- A **FAT32-formatted SD card** and a **USB-to-serial adapter** for testing on hardware

## Building

```bash
# Fetch the proprietary GPU bootloader files (only needed once)
./fetch_boot_files.sh

# Build the kernel
make

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Running on Hardware

1. Format an SD card as **FAT32**.
2. Copy to the root of the SD card:
   - `bootcode.bin`
   - `start.elf`
   - `config.txt`
   - `kernel.img`
3. Connect a serial adapter to **GPIO 14 (TX)** and **GPIO 15 (RX)**.
4. Open a serial terminal at **115200 baud, 8N1**.
5. Insert the SD card and power on the Pi.

Expected typical bootloader output showcasing automated memory allocation lifecycle:

```
Welcome to A6OS!
[DBG] MMU on
[DBG] Process allocated
[DBG] TTBR switched
Lazy allocated page for process.
Allocated page for process.
Freed page for process.
Process exited, returned to kernel.
```
